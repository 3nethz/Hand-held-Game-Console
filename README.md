# Handheld Gaming Console

## Project Overview

This ongoing project aims to develop a handheld gaming console powered by the ESP32 microcontroller. The console features a 2.4" TFT display for retro-style gaming and includes built-in IoT functionality for cloud-based game updates and remote scoreboard synchronization. The project focuses on creating a user-friendly interface, implementing game logic, and optimizing the device for low power consumption to extend battery life.

## Features
- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: The core of the project, handling game logic, display rendering, and IoT connectivity.
- **2.4" TFT Display**: For rendering graphics and displaying game information.
- **IoT Connectivity**: Using the ESP32's built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for cloud-based updates and remote scoreboards.
- **Game Library**: A custom library to draw pixels, lines, shapes, and handle inputs for game development.
- **Low Power Optimization**: Features designed to reduce power consumption and extend battery life.

## Current Progress
- **Week 1**:
  - Completed research on the components and libraries required for the project.
  - Developed and tested a Tetris game in C++ to prototype game logic and UI design.
  - Documented the findings and outlined the next steps for hardware setup and integration with the ESP32.
